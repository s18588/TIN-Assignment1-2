    Esiaest way to do according to your structure I would prefer to put your logo image directly into your html instead of background-image through css. If you would like to do than only need to add image tag between your anchor tag (....) just change your css and html according to below code..

    And I said, let grief be a fallen leaf at the dawning of the day.
