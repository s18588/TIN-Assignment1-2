    <p>
        The UEFA Champions League is a seasonal football competition established in 1955.[1] Prior to the 1992–93 season, <a href="google.com"> the tournament </a> was named the European Cup.[1] The UEFA Champions League is open to the league champions of all UEFA (Union of European Football Associations) member associations (except Liechtenstein, which has no league competition), <a href="google.com"> as well as to the clubs </a> finishing from second to fourth position in the strongest leagues.[2] Originally, only the champions of their respective national league and the defending champions of the competition were allowed to participate. However, this was changed in 1997 to allow the runners-up of the stronger leagues to compete as well, and again in 1999 when third and fourth placed teams of the said leagues also became eligible.[3] In the Champions League era, the defending champions of the competition did not automatically qualify until the rules were changed in 2005 to allow title holders Liverpool to enter the competition.[4]

        <a href="google.com"> The UEFA Europa League </a> (abbreviated as UEL) is an annual football club competition organised by UEFA since 1971 for eligible European football clubs. Clubs qualify for the competition based on their performance in their national leagues and cup competitions. It is now the second-tier competition of European club football, ranking below the UEFA Champions League, after being a third-tier competition from 1971 to 1999 before the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup was discontinued.[1]
